## Code Validation

### HTML

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) service was used to validate the HTML code of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors.

W3C Markup Validator found the following errors in `base.html`:

![home.html validation errors image](assets/testing_files/base_errors.png)

To resolve the error, I moved the modal inside the body tag.

W3C Markup Validator found the following errors in `treatments.html`:

![treatments.html validation errors image](assets/testing_files/treatment_errors.png)

To resolve the error, I wrapped content with a div instead of p and removed redundant closing tags. 

### CSS

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) service was used to validate the CSS code of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors.

W3C CSS Validator found no errors or warnings in the CSS.

![CSS validation image](assets/testing_files/css_validation.png)

### Python

[PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) was used to validate the Python code for PEP8 compliance. As there many files to assess within each app, I have focused on the appointment app for this testing section. 

| Location | Errors / Warnings | Code Reviewed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ./appointments/model.py | ![forms.py errors/warnings image](assets/testing_files/appointments_forms.png) | ![forms.py code reviewed image](assets/testing_files/pep8_forms_reviewed.png) |
| ./appointments/views.py | ![views.py errors/warnings image](assets/testing_files/appointments_views.png) | ![views.py code reviewed image](assets/testing_files/pep8_models_reviewed.png) |
| ./appointments/urls.py | ![urls.py errors/warnings image](assets/testing_files/pep8_urls_errors.png) | ![urls.py code reviewed image](assets/testing_files/pep8_urls_reviewed.png) |

Outside of trailing whitespace and code comments, there were additional issues related to splitting long lines. For example:
* In the treatment field, the line was divided into three parts: `max_length`, `choices`, and `default`. Each part is now on a separate line to keep the overall line length under 79 characters.
* The `__str__` method's return statement was split into two lines using string concatenation, ensuring each line remains within the 79-character limit.


### JavaScript

[JSHint's JavaScript Code Quality Tool](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the site's JavaScript code.

No errors were found.

## Accessibility

Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools was used to confirm that colors & fonts used throughout the website are easy to read and accessible.

### Lighthouse Reports

## Tools Testing

### [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)

Chrome DevTools was used throughout the development process to test, explore, and modify HTML elements and CSS styles.

### Responsiveness

* [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) was used to check the responsiveness of the site pages across different devices.

* Chrome DevTools was used to test responsiveness in different screen sizes during the development process.
